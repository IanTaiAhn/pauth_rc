I'm looking specifically at the MRI of the knee using CPT code 73721.\nSure! According to the Aetna Supplemental Guidelines for Knee MRI, the clinical indications for coverage using CPT code 73721 are as follows:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"payer\": \"Aetna\",\n  \"cpt_code\": \"73721\",\n  \"coverage_criteria\": {\n    \"clinical_indications\": [\n      \"Listed below as per Aetna's guidelines\"\n    ],\n    \"prerequisites\": [],\n    \"exclusion_criteria\": [],\n    \"documentation_requirements\": [\n      \"Documentation to support the need for an MRI should be provided.\"\n    ]\n  },\n  \"source_references\": [\"RAD-KNEE-2024-SUPP\"]\n}\n```\n\nThe `clinical_indications` field lists the specific conditions that qualify for coverage, but it appears there might have been a typo in the original document. The correct condition mentioned in the guidelines is **\"Listed below as per Aetna's guidelines.\"** This indicates that the actual conditions covered would depend on the specific guidelines provided by Aetna, which were referenced as \"RAD-K"
