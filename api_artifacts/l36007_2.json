The goal of total hip or knee replacement surgery is to relieve pain and improve or increase functional activity of the beneficiary.\r\n\r\nJoint replacement, referred to as arthroplasty, has been performed with short and long term favorable outcome over the past several decades and has proven to be an important medical advancement in the field of orthopedic surgery. The hip and knee are the two most commonly replaced joints. The knee is the largest joint in the body and includes the lower end of the femur, the upper end of the tibia and the patella. The knee joint has three compartments, the medial, the lateral and the patellofemoral. The surfaces of these compartments are covered with articular cartilage and are bathed in synovial fluid. The bones of the knee joint work together, allowing the knee to move and function smoothly. The hip is a large weight bearing joint made up of two components: a ball (femoral head) and socket (acetabulum). These components are covered with articular cartilage and are bathed in synovial fluid produced by a synovial membrane.\r\n\r\nThe most common reason for total knee arthroplasty is arthritis of the knee joint. Types of arthritis include osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis and traumatic arthritis (arthritis which occurs as a result of injury). This arthritis causes a severe limitation in the activities of daily living, including impaired ambulation, squatting, and climbing stairs. Pain is typically most severe with activity and patients often have difficulty mobilizing from a sitting position. Other findings include signs of chronic knee inflammation, swelling and stiffness not relieved by rest, non-steroidal anti-inflammatories, physical therapy or other non-surgical therapies such as intra articular injections.\r\n\r\nOsteonecrosis and malignancy are additional reasons to proceed with arthroplasty or total joint replacement.\r\n\r\nTotal hip arthroplasty is most often performed due to severe pain caused by osteoarthritis of the hip joint. Rheumatoid arthritis, traumatic arthritis, malignancy involving the hip joint and osteonecrosis of the femoral head are also indications for hip replacement surgery. The pain from the damaged joint limits activities of daily living, such as walking, or causes disruption of sleep. Pain relief not achieved by taking non-steroidal anti-inflammatory medications and failure to achieve symptom improvement with other conservative therapies such as physical therapy, activity modification and assistive devices are reasons for proceeding with hip arthroplasty or replacement.\r\n\r\nCircumstances that lead to revision or repeat procedure of a total hip or total knee arthroplasty can be necessary due to continued disabling pain or continued decline in function attributed to failure of the primary joint procedure. Failure can be due to infection involving the joint, substantial bone loss in the structures supporting the prosthesis, fracture, aseptic loosening of the components and wear of the prosthetic components. In revisional surgery it is important to provide replacement of the components of the previous surgery responsible for the failure. If either component of the joint remains viable and without infection or deterioration, it is expected that only those failed components will be replaced without injury to the indwelling viable components, e.g., the acetabulum is well seated and without deterioration, only the femoral component should be revised or replaced with a similar matching component. Unavailability of components of a previous arthroplasty requiring the replacement of both components, or failure due to the design of the original components should be clearly documented in the medical record.\r\n\r\nCovered Indications\r\n\r\nThis LCD is only addressing medical necessity criteria for performing total hip and knee replacement surgery. With respect to knee replacement surgery, there is a form of knee joint replacement surgery called unicompartmental knee replacement. This is typically done for patients with osteoarthritis of the knee in which the damage is confined to one compartment of the knee. The indications outlined in this LCD are not to be applied for unicompartmental knee replacement surgery.\r\n\r\nSee Documentation Requirements section for additional information.\r\n\r\nMedicare will consider Total Knee Arthroplasty (TKA) medically reasonable and necessary when three or more of the following criteria are met:\r\n\r\nAdvanced joint disease demonstrated by radiographic supported evidence or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), e.g., fracture or deterioration, distortion of joint surfaces, subchondral cysts, subchondral sclerosis, periarticular osteophytes, joint subluxation, joint space narrowing, avascular necrosis;\r\nHistory of unsuccessful appropriate conservative therapy that is clearly documented in the pre-procedure medical record. Non-surgical medical management is usually implemented for 3 months or more to assess effectiveness. Conservative treatment as clinically appropriate for the patient’s current episode of care typically includes one or more of the following: anti-inflammatory medications; analgesics; flexibility and muscle strengthening exercises with supervised physical therapy.\r\nPain with functional disability due to arthritis or trauma to the knee joint; activities of daily living (ADLs) are diminished despite compliance with plan of care including activity restrictions as is reasonable, assistive device use, weight reduction as appropriate or therapeutic injections into the knee as appropriate;\r\nDistinct structural abnormalities such as:\r\nDistal femur fracture;\r\nProximal tibia fracture;\r\nMalignancy of the distal femur, proximal tibia, knee joint or adjacent soft tissues;\r\nAvascular or other form of osteonecrosis of the knee;\r\nRheumatologic changes precluding or inconsistent with rehabilitation\r\nFailed previous joint replacement/arthroplasty necessitating revision as indicated by any of the following:\r\nLoosening, fracture, or mechanical failure of one or more components;\r\nTechnical or functional failure of previous knee surgery, e.g. unicompartmental knee replacement;\r\nPrevious osteotomy or partial arthroplasty;\r\nInfection;\r\nPeriprosthetic fracture or bone loss of distal femur, proximal tibia or patella; Implant or knee malalignment;\r\nBearing surface wear leading to symptomatic synovitis;\r\nTibiofemoral or extensor mechanism instability; or\r\nKnee stiffness, arthrofibrosis or other destructive conditions that render the knee impaired to the extent to preclude employment or functional activities.\r\nMedicare will consider Total Hip Arthroplasty (THA) medically reasonable and necessary when three or more of the following indications are met:\r\n\r\nAdvanced joint disease demonstrated by radiographic supported evidence or when conventional radiography is not adequate, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) supported evidence (subchondral cysts, subchondral sclerosis, periarticular osteophytes, joint subluxation, joint space narrowing, avascular necrosis);\r\nPain and functional disability from injury due to trauma or arthritis of the joint; activities of daily living (ADLs) are diminished despite completing a plan of care with activity restrictions as is reasonable, assistive device use, appropriate weight reduction, flexibility and muscle strengthening exercises with supervised physical therapy.\r\nHistory of unsuccessful conservative treatment or non-surgical medical management that is clearly documented in the pre-procedure medical record. Non-surgical medical management is usually implemented for 3 months or more to assess effectiveness. Conservative treatment, as clinically appropriate for the patient’s current episode of care, typically includes one or more of the following: anti-inflammatory medications, analgesics, or therapeutic injections when appropriate, with physical therapy or assist devices.\r\nDistinct structural abnormalities\r\nMalignancy of the joint involving the bones or soft tissues of the pelvis or proximal femur;\r\nAvascular necrosis (osteonecrosis of femoral head);\r\nFracture of the femoral neck; Acetabular fracture;\r\nNon-union or failure of previous hip fracture surgery; Mal-union of acetabular or proximal femur fracture;\r\nFailed previous Hip Arthroplasty necessitating revision as indicated by the following:\r\nLoosening, fracture or mechanical failure of the implant;\r\nInstability of one or more components;\r\nRecurrent or irreducible dislocation;\r\nInfection;\r\nDisplaced periprosthetic fracture;\r\nClinically significant leg length inequality;\r\nProgressive soft tissue or bone reaction or substantial bone loss,\r\nClinically significant audible noise; or\r\nBearing surface wear leading to symptomatic synovitis\r\nOther disease or destructive process that renders the hip impaired to the extent to preclude employment or functional activities\r\nLimitations\r\n\r\nThe following are considered not reasonable and necessary and therefore will be denied:\r\n\r\nTKA and THA will not be considered reasonable and necessary when the above indications are not met.\r\nMedicare will consider a total knee replacement or total hip replacement not medically reasonable and necessary when the following contraindications are present:\r\nActive infection of the hip or knee joint or active systemic bacteremia\r\nActive skin infection or open wound within the planned surgical site of the hip or knee\r\nProgressive neurological disease, etiologic for pain, instability or disability\r\n\r\nProvider Qualifications\r\n\r\nServices will be considered medically reasonable and necessary only if performed by appropriately trained providers. This training and expertise must have been acquired within the framework of an accredited residency or fellowship program in the applicable specialty/subspecialty or must reflect extensive continued medical education activities. If these skills have been acquired by way of continued medical education, the courses must be comprehensive, offered or sponsored or endorsed by an academic institution in the United States or by the applicable specialty/subspecialty society in the United States, and designated by the American Medical Association (AMA) as Category 1 Credit. It is expected that these services would be performed as indicated by current medical literature or standards of practice by appropriately trained medical physicians (MD or DO) certified or eligible for certification by the American Board of Orthopaedic Surgery.\r\n\r\nNotice: Services performed for any given diagnosis must meet all of the indications and limitations stated in this policy, the general requirements for medical necessity as stated in CMS payment policy manuals, any and all existing CMS national coverage determinations, and all Medicare payment rules. Refer to Billing and Coding: Lower Extremity Major Joint Replacement (Hip and Knee), A56796, for applicable CPT/HCPCS codes and diagnosis codes.\r\n\r\nThe redetermination process may be utilized for consideration of services performed outside of the reasonable and necessary requirements in this LCD.\r\n\r\nSummary of Evidence\r\nN/A\r\n\r\nAnalysis of Evidence (Rationale for Determination)\r\nN/A\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nGeneral Information\r\nAssociated Information\r\nRefer to the Local Coverage Article: Billing and Coding: Lower Extremity Major Joint Replacement (Hip and Knee), A56796, for all coding information.\r\n\r\nDocumentation Requirements\r\n\r\nAll documentation must be maintained in the patient’s medical record and made available to the contractor upon request.\r\nEvery page of the record must be legible and include appropriate patient identification information (e.g., complete name, dates of service[s]). The documentation must include the legible signature of the physician or non-physician practitioner responsible for and providing the care to the patient.\r\nThe medical record documentation must support the medical necessity of the services as directed in this policy.\r\nIn order to qualify for coverage of both Medicare Part A and Part B services, the medical record must contain documentation that fully supports the medical necessity of the procedure/service performed and must be made available to the Contractor upon request. (Please see below for additional information regarding specific documentation requirements)\r\nDocumentation must support CMS 'signature requirements' as described in the Medicare Program Integrity Manual (Pub. 100-08), Chapter 3.\r\nWhen reviewing claims for procedures with DRGs, please refer to the CMS online Manual, Pub 100-08, Chapter 6, Section, 6.5.2.\r\n\r\nAdditional Documentation Requirements Specific to Joint Arthroplasty:\r\n\r\nNote: The medical records should contain enough detailed information to support the determination that major joint replacement surgery was reasonable and necessary for the patient. Progress notes consisting of only conclusive statements should be avoided.\r\n\r\nAny major procedure has significant benefit and risk (injury or death) that the treating physician discusses with the patient. To meet Medicare’s reasonable and necessary threshold for coverage of a procedure, the physician’s documentation for the case should clearly support (1) the diagnostic criteria for the indication (standard test results, when appropriate, and clinical findings) (2) that the procedure does not exceed the medical need, (3) is at least as beneficial as existing alternatives, and (4) the procedure is furnished within accepted standards of medical practice in a setting appropriate for the patient’s medical needs and condition.\r\n\r\nLacking compelling arguments for an exception in the supporting documentation, both the hospital (facility) and physician services claims may be denied.\r\n\r\nWhen the procedure is indicated for advanced joint disease, in addition to the above items, all of the following shall be documented in the Medical Record.\r\n\r\nArthritis of the knee or hip supported by X-ray or MRI. The X-ray or MRI must demonstrate one of the following: subchondral cysts, subchondral sclerosis, periarticular osteophytes, joint subluxation, joint space narrowing, avascular necrosis or bone on bone articulations.\r\nPain with functional disability at the hip or knee. For example, documented pain that interferes with ADLs (functional disability), or pain that is increased with initiation of activities or pain that increases with weight bearing, or pain precluding sleep.\r\nThe documentation should demonstrate a history of a reasonable attempt (typically 3 months or more) at conservative therapy as appropriate for the patient in the current episode of care. For example, documented trial of NSAIDs or contraindication to such therapy and documented supervised physical therapy.\r\nDocumentation should support that ADLs are diminished due to pain or disability despite non-surgical medical management.\r\nFor patients with significant conditions or co-morbidities, the risk/benefit of non-cardiac surgery, such as TKA or THA should be appropriately addressed in the medical record.\r\nWhen the procedure is for indications outlined in the LCD, other than advanced joint disease, the medical record documentation should include the following, when indicated:\r\n\r\nSupporting evidence (e.g., pathology reports and referral from an Oncologist for a malignancy of the joint or X-ray of a fracture).\r\nHip or Knee Pain when indicated as a reason for the procedure (revision or replacement TKA/THA) should document the functional disability, e.g., pain that interferes with ADLs, that is increased with initiation of activities or pain that restricts weight bearing, impairs sleep and precludes that activity.\r\nFor patients with significant conditions or co-morbidities, the risk/benefit of non-cardiac surgery, such as TKA or THA should be appropriately addressed in the medical record.\r\nWhen infection is the reason for revision TKA or THA surgery, laboratory or pathology reports must be in the medical record. All documentation regarding treatment of the infection and a physician note indicating that it is appropriate to proceed with surgery, should be in the medical record as well.\r\nThe Hospital Record for the procedures in this LCD must include the following:\r\n\r\nA history and physical describing the present issue, the duration of the issue, current signs and symptoms, and any comorbidities;\r\nPhysician progress notes to include physical examination demonstrating any presence of deformity range of motion abnormalities, crepitus, effusion, tenderness, or gait abnormalities;\r\nAn operative report;\r\nAny other relevant information addressing coverage criteria related to the patients episode of care prior to the hospitalization; and\r\nDischarge summary;\r\nIn the instance that the patient is undergoing a bilateral knee or hip replacement, all criteria listed above would apply to the bilateral surgery when indicated. The medical record should also support the medical necessity for performing THA or TKA bilaterally.\r\n\r\nUtilization Guidelines\r\n\r\nIn accordance with CMS Ruling 95-1 (V), utilization of these services should be consistent with locally acceptable standards of practice.\r\n\r\nWhen services are performed in excess of peer norm based on data analysis they may be subject to prepay or post pay medical review.\r\n\r\nThe devices/implants utilized for total knee and total hip replacement surgeries are regulated by the FDA as medical devices. The devices used should be class II or class III devices that meet the requirements outlined in CFR 21, Chapter 1, subchapter H, Part 888 (http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/cdrh/cfdocs/cfcfr/CFRSearch.cfm?CFRPart=888)\r\n\r\nSources of Information\r\nContractor is not responsible for the continued viability of websites listed.\r\n\r\nOther Medicare Contractor's Local Coverage Determinations\r\n\r\nCare Allies medical necessity guidelines: Knee arthroplasty, number 0347.\r\n\r\nCigna medical coverage policy: Knee arthroplasty/replacement, number 0347.\r\n\r\nCigna medical coverage policy: Total hip replacement with metal-on-metal and ceramic-on-ceramic prosthesis, number 0214.\r\n\r\nConsultations with the representatives to the Carrier Advisory Committee and other Medicare Contractors.\r\n\r\nContractor Medical Directors\r\n\r\nOriginal JH/JL ICD-9 Source LCD L35594, Lower Extremity Major Joint Replacement (Hip and Knee)\r\n\r\nBibliography\r\nAckerman, IN, Bennell, KL, and Osborne, RH.

The goal of total hip or knee replacement surgery is to relieve pain and improve or increase functional activity of the beneficiary.\r\n\r\nJoint replacement, referred to as arthroplasty, has been performed with short and long term favorable outcome over the past several decades and has proven to be an important medical advancement in the field of orthopedic surgery. The hip and knee are the two most commonly replaced joints. The knee is the largest joint in the body and includes the lower end of the femur, the upper end of the tibia and the patella. The knee joint has three compartments, the medial, the lateral and the patellofemoral. The surfaces of these compartments are covered with articular cartilage and are bathed in synovial fluid. The bones of the knee joint work together, allowing the knee to move and function smoothly. The hip is a large weight bearing joint made up of two components: a ball (femoral head) and socket (acetabulum). These components are covered with articular cartilage and are bathed in synovial fluid produced by a synovial membrane.\r\n\r\nThe most common reason for total knee arthroplasty is arthritis of the knee joint. Types of arthritis include osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis and traumatic arthritis (arthritis which occurs as a result of injury). This arthritis causes a severe limitation in the activities of daily living, including impaired ambulation, squatting, and climbing stairs. Pain is typically most severe with activity and patients often have difficulty mobilizing from a sitting position. Other findings include signs of chronic knee inflammation, swelling and stiffness not relieved by rest, non-steroidal anti-inflammatories, physical therapy or other non-surgical therapies such as intra articular injections.\r\n\r\nOsteonecrosis and malignancy are additional reasons to proceed with arthroplasty or total joint replacement.\r\n\r\nTotal hip arthroplasty is most often performed due to severe pain caused by osteoarthritis of the hip joint. Rheumatoid arthritis, traumatic arthritis, malignancy involving the hip joint and osteonecrosis of the femoral head are also indications for hip replacement surgery. The pain from the damaged joint limits activities of daily living, such as walking, or causes disruption of sleep. Pain relief not achieved by taking non-steroidal anti-inflammatory medications and failure to achieve symptom improvement with other conservative therapies such as physical therapy, activity modification and assistive devices are reasons for proceeding with hip arthroplasty or replacement.\r\n\r\nCircumstances that lead to revision or repeat procedure of a total hip or total knee arthroplasty can be necessary due to continued disabling pain or continued decline in function attributed to failure of the primary joint procedure. Failure can be due to infection involving the joint, substantial bone loss in the structures supporting the prosthesis, fracture, aseptic loosening of the components and wear of the prosthetic components. In revisional surgery it is important to provide replacement of the components of the previous surgery responsible for the failure. If either component of the joint remains viable and without infection or deterioration, it is expected that only those failed components will be replaced without injury to the indwelling viable components, e.g., the acetabulum is well seated and without deterioration, only the femoral component should be revised or replaced with a similar matching component. Unavailability of components of a previous arthroplasty requiring the replacement of both components, or failure due to the design of the original components should be clearly documented in the medical record.\r\n\r\nCovered Indications\r\n\r\nThis LCD is only addressing medical necessity criteria for performing total hip and knee replacement surgery. With respect to knee replacement surgery, there is a form of knee joint replacement surgery called unicompartmental knee replacement. This is typically done for patients with osteoarthritis of the knee in which the damage is confined to one compartment of the knee. The indications outlined in this LCD are not to be applied for unicompartmental knee replacement surgery.\r\n\r\nSee Documentation Requirements section for additional information.\r\n\r\nMedicare will consider Total Knee Arthroplasty (TKA) medically reasonable and necessary when three or more of the following criteria are met:\r\n\r\nAdvanced joint disease demonstrated by radiographic supported evidence or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), e.g., fracture or deterioration, distortion of joint surfaces, subchondral cysts, subchondral sclerosis, periarticular osteophytes, joint subluxation, joint space narrowing, avascular necrosis;\r\nHistory of unsuccessful appropriate conservative therapy that is clearly documented in the pre-procedure medical record. Non-surgical medical management is usually implemented for 3 months or more to assess effectiveness. Conservative treatment as clinically appropriate for the patient’s current episode of care typically includes one or more of the following: anti-inflammatory medications; analgesics; flexibility and muscle strengthening exercises with supervised physical therapy.\r\nPain with functional disability due to arthritis or trauma to the knee joint; activities of daily living (ADLs) are diminished despite compliance with plan of care including activity restrictions as is reasonable, assistive device use, weight reduction as appropriate or therapeutic injections into the knee as appropriate;\r\nDistinct structural abnormalities such as:\r\nDistal femur fracture;\r\nProximal tibia fracture;\r\nMalignancy of the distal femur, proximal tibia, knee joint or adjacent soft tissues;\r\nAvascular or other form of osteonecrosis of the knee;\r\nRheumatologic changes precluding or inconsistent with rehabilitation\r\nFailed previous joint replacement/arthroplasty necessitating revision as indicated by any of the following:\r\nLoosening, fracture, or mechanical failure of one or more components;\r\nTechnical or functional failure of previous knee surgery, e.g. unicompartmental knee replacement;\r\nPrevious osteotomy or partial arthroplasty;\r\nInfection;\r\nPeriprosthetic fracture or bone loss of distal femur, proximal tibia or patella; Implant or knee malalignment;\r\nBearing surface wear leading to symptomatic synovitis;\r\nTibiofemoral or extensor mechanism instability; or\r\nKnee stiffness, arthrofibrosis or other destructive conditions that render the knee impaired to the extent to preclude employment or functional activities.\r\nMedicare will consider Total Hip Arthroplasty (THA) medically reasonable and necessary when three or more of the following indications are met:\r\n\r\nAdvanced joint disease demonstrated by radiographic supported evidence or when conventional radiography is not adequate, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) supported evidence (subchondral cysts, subchondral sclerosis, periarticular osteophytes, joint subluxation, joint space narrowing, avascular necrosis);\r\nPain and functional disability from injury due to trauma or arthritis of the joint; activities of daily living (ADLs) are diminished despite completing a plan of care with activity restrictions as is reasonable, assistive device use, appropriate weight reduction, flexibility and muscle strengthening exercises with supervised physical therapy.\r\nHistory of unsuccessful conservative treatment or non-surgical medical management that is clearly documented in the pre-procedure medical record. Non-surgical medical management is usually implemented for 3 months or more to assess effectiveness. Conservative treatment, as clinically appropriate for the patient’s current episode of care, typically includes one or more of the following: anti-inflammatory medications, analgesics, or therapeutic injections when appropriate, with physical therapy or assist devices.\r\nDistinct structural abnormalities\r\nMalignancy of the joint involving the bones or soft tissues of the pelvis or proximal femur;\r\nAvascular necrosis (osteonecrosis of femoral head);\r\nFracture of the femoral neck; Acetabular fracture;\r\nNon-union or failure of previous hip fracture surgery; Mal-union of acetabular or proximal femur fracture;\r\nFailed previous Hip Arthroplasty necessitating revision as indicated by the following:\r\nLoosening, fracture or mechanical failure of the implant;\r\nInstability of one or more components;\r\nRecurrent or irreducible dislocation;\r\nInfection;\r\nDisplaced periprosthetic fracture;\r\nClinically significant leg length inequality;\r\nProgressive soft tissue or bone reaction or substantial bone loss,\r\nClinically significant audible noise; or\r\nBearing surface wear leading to symptomatic synovitis\r\nOther disease or destructive process that renders the hip impaired to the extent to preclude employment or functional activities\r\nLimitations\r\n\r\nThe following are considered not reasonable and necessary and therefore will be denied:\r\n\r\nTKA and THA will not be considered reasonable and necessary when the above indications are not met.\r\nMedicare will consider a total knee replacement or total hip replacement not medically reasonable and necessary when the following contraindications are present:\r\nActive infection of the hip or knee joint or active systemic bacteremia\r\nActive skin infection or open wound within the planned surgical site of the hip or knee\r\nProgressive neurological disease, etiologic for pain, instability or disability\r\n\r\nProvider Qualifications\r\n\r\nServices will be considered medically reasonable and necessary only if performed by appropriately trained providers. This training and expertise must have been acquired within the framework of an accredited residency or fellowship program in the applicable specialty/subspecialty or must reflect extensive continued medical education activities. If these skills have been acquired by way of continued medical education, the courses must be comprehensive, offered or sponsored or endorsed by an academic institution in the United States or by the applicable specialty/subspecialty society in the United States, and designated by the American Medical Association (AMA) as Category 1 Credit. It is expected that these services would be performed as indicated by current medical literature or standards of practice by appropriately trained medical physicians (MD or DO) certified or eligible for certification by the American Board of Orthopaedic Surgery.\r\n\r\nNotice: Services performed for any given diagnosis must meet all of the indications and limitations stated in this policy, the general requirements for medical necessity as stated in CMS payment policy manuals, any and all existing CMS national coverage determinations, and all Medicare payment rules. Refer to Billing and Coding: Lower Extremity Major Joint Replacement (Hip and Knee), A56796, for applicable CPT/HCPCS codes and diagnosis codes.\r\n\r\nThe redetermination process may be utilized for consideration of services performed outside of the reasonable and necessary requirements in this LCD.\r\n\r\nSummary of Evidence\r\nN/A\r\n\r\nAnalysis of Evidence (Rationale for Determination)\r\nN/A\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nGeneral Information\r\nAssociated Information\r\nRefer to the Local Coverage Article: Billing and Coding: Lower Extremity Major Joint Replacement (Hip and Knee), A56796, for all coding information.\r\n\r\nDocumentation Requirements\r\n\r\nAll documentation must be maintained in the patient’s medical record and made available to the contractor upon request.\r\nEvery page of the record must be legible and include appropriate patient identification information (e.g., complete name, dates of service[s]). The documentation must include the legible signature of the physician or non-physician practitioner responsible for and providing the care to the patient.\r\nThe medical record documentation must support the medical necessity of the services as directed in this policy.\r\nIn order to qualify for coverage of both Medicare Part A and Part B services, the medical record must contain documentation that fully supports the medical necessity of the procedure/service performed and must be made available to the Contractor upon request. (Please see below for additional information regarding specific documentation requirements)\r\nDocumentation must support CMS 'signature requirements' as described in the Medicare Program Integrity Manual (Pub. 100-08), Chapter 3.\r\nWhen reviewing claims for procedures with DRGs, please refer to the CMS online Manual, Pub 100-08, Chapter 6, Section, 6.5.2.\r\n\r\nAdditional Documentation Requirements Specific to Joint Arthroplasty:\r\n\r\nNote: The medical records should contain enough detailed information to support the determination that major joint replacement surgery was reasonable and necessary for the patient. Progress notes consisting of only conclusive statements should be avoided.\r\n\r\nAny major procedure has significant benefit and risk (injury or death) that the treating physician discusses with the patient. To meet Medicare’s reasonable and necessary threshold for coverage of a procedure, the physician’s documentation for the case should clearly support (1) the diagnostic criteria for the indication (standard test results, when appropriate, and clinical findings) (2) that the procedure does not exceed the medical need, (3) is at least as beneficial as existing alternatives, and (4) the procedure is furnished within accepted standards of medical practice in a setting appropriate for the patient’s medical needs and condition.\r\n\r\nLacking compelling arguments for an exception in the supporting documentation, both the hospital (facility) and physician services claims may be denied.\r\n\r\nWhen the procedure is indicated for advanced joint disease, in addition to the above items, all of the following shall be documented in the Medical Record.\r\n\r\nArthritis of the knee or hip supported by X-ray or MRI. The X-ray or MRI must demonstrate one of the following: subchondral cysts, subchondral sclerosis, periarticular osteophytes, joint subluxation, joint space narrowing, avascular necrosis or bone on bone articulations.\r\nPain with functional disability at the hip or knee. For example, documented pain that interferes with ADLs (functional disability), or pain that is increased with initiation of activities or pain that increases with weight bearing, or pain precluding sleep.\r\nThe documentation should demonstrate a history of a reasonable attempt (typically 3 months or more) at conservative therapy as appropriate for the patient in the current episode of care. For example, documented trial of NSAIDs or contraindication to such therapy and documented supervised physical therapy.\r\nDocumentation should support that ADLs are diminished due to pain or disability despite non-surgical medical management.\r\nFor patients with significant conditions or co-morbidities, the risk/benefit of non-cardiac surgery, such as TKA or THA should be appropriately addressed in the medical record.\r\nWhen the procedure is for indications outlined in the LCD, other than advanced joint disease, the medical record documentation should include the following, when indicated:\r\n\r\nSupporting evidence (e.g., pathology reports and referral from an Oncologist for a malignancy of the joint or X-ray of a fracture).\r\nHip or Knee Pain when indicated as a reason for the procedure (revision or replacement TKA/THA) should document the functional disability, e.g., pain that interferes with ADLs, that is increased with initiation of activities or pain that restricts weight bearing, impairs sleep and precludes that activity.\r\nFor patients with significant conditions or co-morbidities, the risk/benefit of non-cardiac surgery, such as TKA or THA should be appropriately addressed in the medical record.\r\nWhen infection is the reason for revision TKA or THA surgery, laboratory or pathology reports must be in the medical record. All documentation regarding treatment of the infection and a physician note indicating that it is appropriate to proceed with surgery, should be in the medical record as well.\r\nThe Hospital Record for the procedures in this LCD must include the following:\r\n\r\nA history and physical describing the present issue, the duration of the issue, current signs and symptoms, and any comorbidities;\r\nPhysician progress notes to include physical examination demonstrating any presence of deformity range of motion abnormalities, crepitus, effusion, tenderness, or gait abnormalities;\r\nAn operative report;\r\nAny other relevant information addressing coverage criteria related to the patients episode of care prior to the hospitalization; and\r\nDischarge summary;\r\nIn the instance that the patient is undergoing a bilateral knee or hip replacement, all criteria listed above would apply to the bilateral surgery when indicated. The medical record should also support the medical necessity for performing THA or TKA bilaterally.\r\n\r\nUtilization Guidelines\r\n\r\nIn accordance with CMS Ruling 95-1 (V), utilization of these services should be consistent with locally acceptable standards of practice.\r\n\r\nWhen services are performed in excess of peer norm based on data analysis they may be subject to prepay or post pay medical review.\r\n\r\nThe devices/implants utilized for total knee and total hip replacement surgeries are regulated by the FDA as medical devices. The devices used should be class II or class III devices that meet the requirements outlined in CFR 21, Chapter 1, subchapter H, Part 888 (http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/cdrh/cfdocs/cfcfr/CFRSearch.cfm?CFRPart=888)\r\n\r\nSources of Information\r\nContractor is not responsible for the continued viability of websites listed.\r\n\r\nOther Medicare Contractor's Local Coverage Determinations\r\n\r\nCare Allies medical necessity guidelines: Knee arthroplasty, number 0347.\r\n\r\nCigna medical coverage policy: Knee arthroplasty/replacement, number 0347.\r\n\r\nCigna medical coverage policy: Total hip replacement with metal-on-metal and ceramic-on-ceramic prosthesis, number 0214.\r\n\r\nConsultations with the representatives to the Carrier Advisory Committee and other Medicare Contractors.\r\n\r\nContractor Medical Directors\r\n\r\nOriginal JH/JL ICD-9 Source LCD L35594, Lower Extremity Major Joint Replacement (Hip and Knee)\r\n\r\nBibliography\r\nAckerman, IN, Bennell, KL, and Osborne, RH.
