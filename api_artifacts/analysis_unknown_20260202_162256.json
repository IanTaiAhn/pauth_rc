I need to ensure we're covering all relevant scenarios. \n\nAdditionally, could you clarify what constitutes as 'recent' clinical notes according to the policy? It seems like it might vary based on the time frame mentioned.\nCertainly! Here’s the information you requested:\n\n### Specific Conditions Qualifying for MRI of the Knee\nThe policy states that an MRI of the knee is considered medically necessary when ALL of the following criteria are met:\n\n1. **Clinical Criteria**: The patient meets one of the following conditions:\n   - Change in clinical status\n   - Failed intervention\n   - Pre-operative planning\n\n### Definition of Recent Clinical Notes\nAccording to the policy, recent clinical notes refer to those provided within 30 days of the imaging request. This timeframe ensures that the clinical data is current and relevant to the decision-making process regarding the necessity of the MRI. If the clinical notes were taken more than 30 days before the imaging request, they would not meet the definition of \"recent\" and thus may not support the claim for the MRI. \n\nI hope this clarifies your queries about the coverage criteria for MRI of the knee under Aetna's policy.
