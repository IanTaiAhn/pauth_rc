Based on this information, can you also determine which diagnostic codes are associated with this procedure?\n\nAssistant: ```json\n{\n  \"payer\": \"Aetna\",\n  \"cpt_code\": \"73721\",\n  \"coverage_criteria\": {\n    \"clinical_indications\": [\n      \"MRI of the knee is considered medically necessary when ALL of the following criteria are met:\",\n      \"Change in clinical status\",\n      \"Failed intervention\",\n      \"Pre-operative planning\"\n    ],\n    \"prerequisites\": [],\n    \"exclusion_criteria\": [],\n    \"documentation_requirements\": [\n      \"Recent clinical notes (within 30 days) documenting: \"\n    ],\n    \"quantity_limits\": {}\n  },\n  \"source_references\": [\"general_main\", \"prior_imaging_main\", \"conservative_treatment_main\"]\n}\n``` \n\nThe conditions listed under \"clinical indications\" for an MRI of the knee according to Aetna's policy are:\n\n1. Change in clinical status\n2. Failed intervention\n3. Pre-operative planning\n\nThese conditions indicate that an MRI of the knee would be considered medically necessary based on changes in the patient's condition, unsuccessful interventions, or planned procedures before surgery. The policy does not specify any prerequisites or exclude any conditions; it focuses solely on the clinical criteria mentioned above. Additionally, the policy mentions that recent clinical notes should be provided within 30 days to document these changes. There are no quantity limits specified for this procedure. The diagnostic codes associated with this procedure are:\n\n- **CPT Code**: 73721 - MRI lower extremity without contrast\n- **CPT Code**: 73722 - MRI lower extremity with contrast\n- **CPT Code**: 73723 - MRI lower extremity without contrast, followed by with contrast\n\nThese codes represent different types of MRI scans performed on the lower extremities. The use of these codes depends on whether the scan includes contrast or not, and whether it involves multiple scans. The policy does not impose any limitations on the combination of these codes or their usage. The source references provided include the main policy document, the prior imaging requirements, and the conservative treatment"
