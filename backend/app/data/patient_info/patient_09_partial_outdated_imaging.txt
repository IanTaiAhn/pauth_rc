CHIEF COMPLAINT:
Left knee pain x 6 months

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:
45-year-old female teacher presenting with 6 months of left knee pain. Onset
was gradual after she increased her walking for a weight loss program. Pain is
medial, rated 6/10 with prolonged standing and stairs. She notes a "pop"
sensation several months ago that was followed by increased swelling.
Effusion has been intermittent since. Symptoms significantly limit her ability
to stand during teaching hours.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:

  Lachman: Negative
  ROM: 0-125 degrees

IMAGING:
  X-ray Left Knee — DATED 10/01/2024 (118 days ago / approximately 4 months ago):
  Report on file: Mild medial compartment narrowing Grade 1. Small
  osteophytes. No acute fracture. Mild effusion noted.

  NOTE FOR PA SUBMISSION: X-ray was performed 118 days prior to today's
  visit. Utah Medicaid requires imaging within 60 days prior to MRI request.
  NEW X-RAYS WILL NEED TO BE ORDERED before PA submission to meet imaging
  recency requirement. See plan below.

ASSESSMENT:
  Suspected medial meniscal tear, left knee (ICD-10: M23.202)

CONSERVATIVE TREATMENT COMPLETED:
Duration: 6 months (July 2024 - January 2025)

  Physical therapy: 2x weekly x 8 weeks (16 sessions completed)
    - Quad strengthening, gait training
    - Outcome: Modest improvement early, symptom plateau at week 6,
      recurrence of effusion at week 8

  NSAIDs: Naproxen 500mg BID x 6 weeks — partial relief, GI tolerability issues
  Acetaminophen: Switched to 1000mg TID x 4 weeks — minimal additional benefit
  Corticosteroid injection: 09/15/2024 — temporary relief x 6 weeks, recurrence
  Activity modification: Modified teaching duties, seated instruction periods added

6 months of multimodal conservative care attempted. Patient has failed adequate
conservative management. Clinical examination is consistent with meniscal pathology.

PLAN:
  1. Order repeat weight-bearing X-ray left knee today to meet 60-day imaging
     recency requirement for Medicaid PA submission
  2. Once new X-ray obtained and report available (within 24-48 hours), PA for
     MRI Left Knee without contrast (CPT: 73721) will be submitted
  3. Patient counseled that PA cannot be submitted with 4-month-old X-ray —
     new imaging required per payer policy

  PA submission is pending repeat X-ray. All other clinical criteria are met.
  Conservative care is complete and failed. Patient is appropriate for MRI
  once imaging recency requirement is satisfied.
