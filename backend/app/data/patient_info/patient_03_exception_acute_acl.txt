MEDICAL NECESSITY / EXCEPTION DOCUMENTATION:
This patient meets EXCEPTION criteria for MRI without completion of conservative
care requirement per Utah Medicaid Imaging Policy, Section 3:

  Exception criteria met:
  [X] Acute traumatic injury with inability to bear weight
  [X] Suspected complete ligament rupture (ACL) — Lachman 3+, positive pivot shift
  [X] Positive Segond fracture sign on X-ray (pathognomonic for ACL tear)
  [X] Hemarthrosis requiring aspiration

  Conservative care waiver is clinically appropriate. Immediate MRI is required
  to: (1) confirm complete vs. partial ACL tear, (2) assess for meniscal injury
  (high co-occurrence rate with ACL tears), (3) guide surgical planning and
  timing of ACL reconstruction.

  Ordering: MRI Left Knee without contrast (CPT: 73721) — URGENT/STAT
