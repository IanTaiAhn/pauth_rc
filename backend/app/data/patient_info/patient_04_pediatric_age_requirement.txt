pain. Pain is primarily anterior and medial, rated 6/10 with activity. He notices
pain during and after soccer practice and games. Intermittent swelling. He reports
a "clicking" sensation with squatting. No acute traumatic event. Growing

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
  No significant PMH
  No prior knee surgeries
  Immunizations: Up to date

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:
Vitals: BP 112/68, HR 72, Temp 98.6°F
Height: 5'6" (growing — 2" in past year)
Weight: 145 lbs
BMI: 23.4

Right Knee:
  Inspection: Mild effusion, tibial tubercle mildly prominent and tender
  Palpation: Medial joint line tenderness ++, tibial tubercle tenderness ++
  ROM: Full 0-140 degrees
  McMurray's test: Mildly positive medial side at 90 degrees
  Lachman: Negative
  Patellar apprehension: Negative
  Tibial tubercle tenderness: Present (Osgood-Schlatter vs. pathology)

PEDIATRIC ORTHOPEDIC EVALUATION (Required for Medicaid members under 18):
  Pediatric orthopedic evaluation performed at this visit by board-certified
  pediatric orthopedic surgeon (Dr. Huang). Growth plate assessment: Open
  physes noted on X-ray — Risser Grade 1. Physeal protection required in any
  surgical planning.

DIAGNOSTIC IMAGING:
  X-ray Right Knee (AP, lateral, tunnel views) - 01/22/2025:
  Open physes, Risser Grade 1. No acute fracture. No OCD lesion visible on
  plain film. Prominent tibial tubercle consistent with Osgood-Schlatter. Mild
  effusion. Intercondylar notch appears narrowed on tunnel view.

ASSESSMENT:
  1. Suspected medial meniscal pathology vs. discoid meniscus, right knee
     (ICD-10: M23.201)
  2. Osgood-Schlatter disease, right knee (ICD-10: M92.521) — secondary finding
  3. Open physes — surgical approach must account for growth plates

CONSERVATIVE TREATMENT COMPLETED:
Duration: 10 weeks (11/01/2024 - 01/10/2025)

  Physical therapy: 2x weekly x 8 weeks (16 sessions)
    - Pediatric PT program at Primary Children's
    - Quad/hamstring strengthening, proprioception, sport-specific training
    - Outcome: Improvement in Osgood-Schlatter symptoms; persistent medial
      knee pain and clicking with activity

  NSAIDs: Ibuprofen 400mg TID with food, 6-week trial
    - Parental weight-based dosing (10mg/kg)
    - Outcome: Partial pain reduction, mechanical symptoms persist

  Activity modification: Reduced soccer training load x 6 weeks
    - Patient remains symptomatic despite load reduction

PLAN:
Despite 10 weeks conservative management including PT, NSAIDs, and activity
modification, patient has persistent medial joint line pain and mechanical
symptoms inconsistent with Osgood-Schlatter alone.

Recommending MRI Right Knee without contrast (CPT: 73721) to evaluate for:
  - Discoid lateral meniscus
  - Medial meniscal tear
  - OCD lesion not visible on plain film
  - Physeal integrity

MRI is medically necessary to guide physis-protective surgical planning if
meniscal pathology confirmed. Pediatric orthopedic evaluation has been completed
as required.

Parent consented. Tyler verbalized understanding. Questions answered.
