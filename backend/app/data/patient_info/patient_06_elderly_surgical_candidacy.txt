CHIEF COMPLAINT:
Bilateral knee pain, right greater than left, x 7 months

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:
72-year-old female with bilateral knee pain presenting for evaluation of right
knee pain primarily. Right knee pain began approximately 7 months ago, insidious
onset. She reports medial knee pain rated 6/10 with ambulation, difficulty with
stairs and rising from chairs. Pain awakens her from sleep 2-3 nights per week.
Intermittent locking sensation right knee. She uses a cane for ambulation and
has significantly reduced her activity level.

She lives independently but reports difficulty with housekeeping activities.
Has caregiver support 3 days/week for meals and transportation.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
  Hypertension (controlled, lisinopril 10mg)
  Type 2 Diabetes (A1c 7.2%, metformin + glipizide)
  Osteopenia (DEXA 2023, spine T-score -1.8)
  Chronic kidney disease Stage 2 (GFR 68)
  No prior knee surgeries

MEDICATIONS: See medication reconciliation form (attached)

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:
Vitals: BP 144/88, HR 74, Temp 98.4°F
Height: 5'3" (160 cm)
Weight: 167 lbs (75.7 kg)
BMI: 29.6

Gait: Antalgic gait right > left, using single-point cane
Right Knee:
  Inspection: Moderate effusion, mild varus deformity noted
  Palpation: Medial joint line tenderness ++, medial femoral condyle tenderness +
  ROM: Flexion 0-105 degrees (limited by pain)
  McMurray's: Positive medial rotation
  Varus stress: Mild instability consistent with medial compartment loss
  Neurovascular: Intact, mild pitting edema bilateral ankles

Left Knee: Mild medial joint line tenderness, no effusion, ROM 0-125 degrees

DIAGNOSTIC IMAGING:
  X-ray Right Knee (standing AP, lateral, Rosenberg) - 01/20/2025:
  Moderate to severe medial compartment joint space narrowing (Grade 3 of 4).
  Significant osteophyte formation medial and lateral compartments. Varus
  alignment on standing views. Subchondral sclerosis and cyst formation medial
  plateau. Lateral and patellofemoral compartments relatively preserved.

ASSESSMENT:
  1. Medial compartment osteoarthritis, right knee, severe (ICD-10: M17.11)
  2. Suspected medial meniscal tear vs. degenerative meniscal changes (ICD-10: M23.201)
  3. Bilateral knee osteoarthritis, left knee moderate (ICD-10: M17.12)

CONSERVATIVE TREATMENT COMPLETED:
Duration: 7 months (June 2024 - January 2025)

  Physical therapy: 2x weekly x 8 weeks (16 sessions)
    - Home exercise program maintained
    - Aquatic PT x 4 weeks (per renal and DM precautions)
    - Outcome: Modest functional improvement initially, regression over past
      2 months. Persistent pain and mechanical symptoms.

  NSAIDs: Contraindicated due to CKD Stage 2 and GI history
    - Acetaminophen 1000mg TID used as alternative (documented)
    - Topical diclofenac gel x 8 weeks — partial relief

  Corticosteroid injection: 2 injections (08/2024 and 11/2024)
    - Both provided temporary relief x 4-6 weeks each
    - Caution with further steroid use given diabetes

  Bracing: Unloader brace fitted and used x 3 months
  Activity modification: Cane use, reduced ambulation, chair exercises

SURGICAL CANDIDACY AND FUNCTIONAL IMPACT ASSESSMENT:
(Required per Medicaid policy for members age 65+)

  Functional impact: Patient reports significant functional limitations:
  - Unable to climb stairs without handrail and assistance
  - Cannot ambulate >1 block without stopping for pain
  - Requires cane for all ambulation
  - Sleep disturbance 2-3 nights/week from knee pain
  - Loss of independence in household tasks

  Surgical candidacy assessment:
  - Patient has been counseled on surgical options including total knee
    arthroplasty (TKA) and possible partial knee arthroplasty
  - Medical optimization discussed: diabetes and hypertension well-controlled,
    acceptable surgical risk per anesthesia pre-op evaluation (ASA Class II-III)
  - Patient IS a surgical candidate and is interested in proceeding if
    MRI confirms surgical indication
  - Renal function stable, no contraindication to general or spinal anesthesia
  - Patient understands risks and benefits and wishes to pursue surgical
    evaluation after MRI

PLAN:
MRI Right Knee without contrast (CPT: 73721) requested to:
  1. Characterize meniscal tear pattern and severity to determine surgical
     approach (TKA vs. partial arthroplasty vs. arthroscopic intervention)
  2. Evaluate articular cartilage and subchondral bone in all three compartments
  3. Assess ligamentous integrity prior to surgical planning

Patient is age 72, has failed 7 months of multimodal conservative care, has
significant functional limitations, and is a surgical candidate — MRI is
medically necessary for pre-operative surgical planning.
