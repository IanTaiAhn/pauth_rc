is subject to WC billing and authorization.

MRI Right Knee (CPT 73721) requested for evaluation of suspected meniscal tear.

Note for billing and PA team: Utah Medicaid EXCLUDES worker's compensation
cases from standard PA approval pathway per policy. If WC carrier denies MRI
authorization, or if injury is determined not compensable, Medicaid eligibility
for this procedure should be reassessed under standard medical necessity criteria.

Orthopedic evaluation has been completed. Clinical criteria for MRI are met
based on examination and failed conservative care. PA submission should route
through WC carrier first.
