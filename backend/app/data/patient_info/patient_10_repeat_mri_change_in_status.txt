ORTHOPEDIC FOLLOW-UP NOTE
# SYNTHETIC TEST DATA ONLY — NOT REAL PHI

Patient Name: Tiffany Osei
DOB: 11/14/1983 (Age: 41)
MRN: ORH-2024-3390
Date of Visit: January 23, 2025
Provider: Dr. Angela Torres, MD — Orthopedic Surgery

INSURANCE INFORMATION:
Primary Insurance: Utah Medicaid Adult
Member ID: UT-MCD-228745691

CHIEF COMPLAINT:
Right knee follow-up — worsening symptoms after failed non-surgical management

RELEVANT HISTORY — PRIOR MRI:
Prior MRI Right Knee — Performed: August 14, 2024 (5 months ago)
  Results: Grade 2 radial tear posterior horn medial meniscus. No full-thickness
  chondral defects. ACL intact. Small Baker's cyst.

Following MRI results in August 2024, patient declined surgical intervention
and opted for continued non-surgical management with orthopedic supervision.
PT was continued and a corticosteroid injection was performed in September 2024.

CURRENT VISIT — CHANGE IN CLINICAL STATUS:
Patient now presents with significant change in clinical status since prior MRI:

  NEW symptoms (onset December 2024):
  - Locking episodes: 3-4 times per week (was ABSENT on August 2024 MRI)
  - Giving-way episodes: Twice in past 3 weeks
  - Increased pain: Now 8/10 with activity (was 5/10 in August 2024)
  - Significant functional decline: Now uses cane, unable to perform
    occupational duties as a nurse (on FMLA leave)

  Prior MRI (August 2024) did NOT show features consistent with locked knee
  or displaced meniscal fragment. Current locking episodes suggest progression
  to displaced/bucket-handle tear configuration.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:
Right Knee:
  Moderate to large effusion (significantly worse than August 2024 visit)
  McMurray: Positive with palpable clunk (new — mechanical block to extension)
  Extension block: Cannot fully extend right knee (lacks 10 degrees of full
  extension) — NEW finding, not present in August 2024
  Lachman: Negative
  ROM: Extension limited to -10 degrees, flexion 0-105 degrees

IMAGING:
  X-ray Right Knee (01/23/2025 — within 60 days):
  Interval increase in effusion compared to prior films. Otherwise stable.

REPEAT MRI MEDICAL NECESSITY:
Prior MRI: August 14, 2024 (within 12-month window — repeat requires
documentation of change in clinical status per Utah Medicaid policy)

  CHANGE IN CLINICAL STATUS DOCUMENTED:
  [X] New mechanical locking episodes (absent on prior MRI evaluation)
  [X] New extension block on examination (absent on prior MRI)
  [X] Significant functional decline (nurse on FMLA — new)
  [X] Failed intervention: Non-surgical management + injection failed
  [X] Clinical findings now suggest displaced/bucket-handle configuration
      not present on prior August 2024 MRI — new surgical planning required

  All three accepted criteria for repeat imaging within 12 months are met:
  (a) Change in clinical status — YES (locking, extension block, functional decline)
  (b) Failed intervention — YES (non-surgical management and injection failed)
  (c) Pre-operative planning — YES (now surgical candidate given locked knee)

PLAN:
MRI Right Knee without contrast (CPT: 73721) — REPEAT within 12 months
  Fully justified by documented change in clinical status, failed intervention,
  and pre-operative planning requirement.
  
  PA submission with change in clinical status documentation attached.
