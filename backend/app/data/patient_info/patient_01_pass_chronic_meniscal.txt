# SYNTHETIC TEST DATA ONLY — NOT REAL PHI

Patient Name: Carlos Mendez
DOB: 07/14/1971 (Age: 53)
MRN: ORH-2024-7741
Date of Visit: January 28, 2025
Provider: Dr. Angela Torres, MD - Orthopedic Surgery

INSURANCE INFORMATION:
Primary Insurance: Utah Medicaid (CHIP/Adult)
Member ID: UT-MCD-448821903
Group #: N/A - State Plan

CHIEF COMPLAINT:
Left knee pain and swelling x 5 months

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:
Mr. Mendez is a 53-year-old male presenting with progressive left knee pain that
began approximately 5 months ago after a fall from a ladder at his construction job.
He reports pain rated 8/10 with weight-bearing activities, kneeling, and climbing.
He describes a mechanical "catching" sensation with ambulation and intermittent
locking of the knee. Significant effusion developed within weeks of injury and has
not resolved. He has been unable to return to work.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
  Type 2 Diabetes (well-controlled on metformin)
  Hypertension
  No prior knee surgeries or injuries

SOCIAL HISTORY:
  Construction laborer (on work restrictions)
  Non-smoker
  Married, 3 children

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:
Vitals: BP 138/86, HR 78, Temp 98.4°F
Height: 5'9" (175.3 cm)
Weight: 198 lbs (89.8 kg)
BMI: 29.2

Left Knee Examination:
  Inspection: Moderate to large effusion, no erythema
  Palpation: Medial joint line tenderness +++, lateral joint line tenderness +
  ROM: Flexion 0-110 degrees (limited by pain and effusion)
  McMurray's test: Positive medial rotation (clunk palpable)
  Thessaly test: Positive at 20 degrees medial compartment loading
  Lachman test: Negative (firm endpoint)
  Varus/valgus stress: Stable at 0 and 30 degrees
  Joint line tenderness: Medial > lateral

DIAGNOSTIC IMAGING:
  X-ray Left Knee (3 views) - 01/28/2025:
  Findings: Moderate medial compartment joint space narrowing. Grade 2 medial
  osteoarthritis changes. Small subchondral sclerosis. No acute fracture.
  No loose bodies identified. Moderate effusion.

ASSESSMENT:
  1. Suspected medial meniscal tear, left knee (ICD-10: M23.202)
  2. Medial compartment osteoarthritis, left knee (ICD-10: M17.12)
  3. Knee effusion (ICD-10: M25.462)

CONSERVATIVE TREATMENT COMPLETED:
Patient has completed 8 weeks of conservative management (11/20/2024 - 01/16/2025):

  Physical therapy: 3x weekly x 8 weeks (24 sessions total)
    - Facility: Mountain View Physical Therapy, Salt Lake City UT
    - Focus: Quad/hamstring strengthening, gait training, aquatic therapy
    - PT notes: "Patient fully compliant. Persistent effusion and mechanical
      symptoms despite structured therapy. Functional gains limited by pain."
    - Final PT assessment: Therapy failed to resolve symptoms

  NSAIDs: Naproxen 500mg BID x 8 weeks
    - Outcome: Partial relief of pain, effusion unchanged
    - No GI complications

  Corticosteroid injection: Single injection 12/10/2024
    - Methylprednisolone 80mg/mL with lidocaine, left knee
    - Outcome: Temporary relief x 3 weeks, symptoms returned

  Activity modification: Full work restriction from construction duties
  Ice therapy and compression wrapping daily

Despite 8 weeks of multimodal conservative care including PT, NSAIDs, and
corticosteroid injection, patient continues to have significant functional
limitations preventing return to work and affecting all weight-bearing activities.
Mechanical symptoms (catching, locking) persist and are consistent with displaced
meniscal fragment.

PLAN:
MRI Left Knee without contrast (CPT: 73721) is medically necessary to:
  1. Characterize meniscal tear pattern (horizontal, radial, complex) to guide
     surgical vs. continued conservative management decision
  2. Evaluate articular cartilage status given radiographic OA changes
  3. Assess for associated ligamentous injury

Procedure is medically necessary to guide treatment planning. Patient has failed
adequate conservative care and has mechanical symptoms requiring further evaluation.

Patient counseled on MRI findings and surgical options discussion to follow.
Written consent obtained. Questions answered.
