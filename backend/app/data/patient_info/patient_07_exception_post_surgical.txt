ORTHOPEDIC FOLLOW-UP NOTE — POST-OPERATIVE
# SYNTHETIC TEST DATA ONLY — NOT REAL PHI

Patient Name: Jasmine Tran
DOB: 06/30/1988 (Age: 36)
MRN: ORH-2024-9930
Date of Visit: January 24, 2025
Provider: Dr. Angela Torres, MD — Orthopedic Surgery
Visit Type: Post-Operative Follow-Up (Week 14)

INSURANCE INFORMATION:
Primary Insurance: Utah Medicaid Adult
Member ID: UT-MCD-330872215

PROCEDURE HISTORY:
  Surgery Date: October 15, 2024
  Procedure: Right knee arthroscopy with partial medial meniscectomy
  CPT: 29881
  Facility: Mountain West Surgical Center
  Surgeon: Dr. Angela Torres, MD
  Operative findings: Bucket-handle medial meniscal tear confirmed.
  Partial meniscectomy performed. Articular cartilage Grade 2 changes noted
  medial femoral condyle at time of surgery.

CHIEF COMPLAINT:
New onset lateral knee pain and renewed effusion at 14 weeks post-op

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:
Ms. Tran is presenting at 14 weeks following right knee arthroscopy with partial
medial meniscectomy. Initial post-operative course was uncomplicated — she
completed post-op PT protocol weeks 1-10 without issue and had returned to
light work duties at week 8.

Over the past 3 weeks she has developed NEW lateral-sided knee pain and renewed
effusion that was not present at her 8-week post-op visit. Pain is 6/10 with
activity, 3/10 at rest. She reports a new sensation of "instability" on uneven
ground. These symptoms are distinctly different from her original medial pain
and represent a CHANGE IN CLINICAL STATUS from her most recent evaluation.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:
Right Knee (14 weeks post-op):
  Surgical incisions: Well-healed portal sites, no signs of infection
  Effusion: Moderate — NEW (was absent at 8-week visit)
  Medial joint line: Minimal tenderness (expected post-meniscectomy changes)
  Lateral joint line tenderness: ++ NEW
  McMurray lateral: Positive NEW
  Lachman: Negative
  Fibular head: Non-tender (rules out proximal fibula pathology)
  ROM: 0-130 degrees (improved from pre-op 0-110)

IMAGING:
  X-ray Right Knee (01/24/2025):
  No hardware. Appropriate post-meniscectomy changes medial compartment.
  Lateral compartment: No significant change from pre-operative films.

ASSESSMENT:
  1. Status post right knee arthroscopy with partial medial meniscectomy
     (ICD-10: Z96.651)
  2. New lateral knee pain and effusion — CHANGE IN CLINICAL STATUS
  3. Rule out lateral meniscal tear, new onset (ICD-10: M23.201)
  4. Rule out chondral injury lateral compartment

MEDICAL NECESSITY / POST-OPERATIVE EXCEPTION:
This patient meets the POST-OPERATIVE EXCEPTION for MRI without conservative
care requirement per Utah Medicaid Imaging Policy:

  [X] Post-operative evaluation within 6 months of knee surgery
  Surgical date: October 15, 2024 — MRI requested January 24, 2025
  Time since surgery: 14 weeks (well within 6-month exception window)

  Additionally: CHANGE IN CLINICAL STATUS documented
  - New lateral-sided symptoms not present at 8-week follow-up
  - New effusion (absent post-operatively until now)
  - New positive McMurray lateral side
  - Failed prior intervention (partial meniscectomy was performed for medial
    pathology; new lateral symptoms represent a new clinical problem)

MRI Right Knee without contrast (CPT: 73721) requested to evaluate for:
  - Lateral meniscal tear (new pathology)
  - Articular cartilage injury lateral compartment
  - Any post-operative complication (cyst, hardware reaction — none expected)
