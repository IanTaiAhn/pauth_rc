Despite 8 weeks of conservative care, patient continues to have significant
functional limitations affecting work and daily activities.PLAN:

meniscal pathology, recommend:

MRI Right Knee without contrast (CPT: 73721) to evaluate for meniscal tear
and assess cartilage status
Follow-up after MRI to discuss results and surgical vs continued conservative
options
The procedure is medically necessary to guide treatment planning and determine
if arthroscopic intervention is warranted.Patient counseled on risks/benefits. Questions answered. Patient agrees with plan.
