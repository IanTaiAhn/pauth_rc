TRIAGE COMPLAINT:
Right knee swelling, warmth, fever — "can't walk"

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:
59-year-old male with Type 2 diabetes (A1c 9.8% — poorly controlled) presenting
with 3-day history of rapidly progressive right knee pain, swelling, and warmth.
Fever to 102.4°F at home. Unable to bear weight. No recent trauma. No recent
joint aspiration or injection.

Denies recent skin break or wound near knee but notes he cut his foot on
garden debris 2 weeks ago — wound "seemed to heal."

History of gout but reports this presentation is distinctly different from
prior gout flares — more severe, associated with fever.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
  Type 2 Diabetes (poorly controlled)
  Gout (managed with allopurinol — recently non-compliant)
  Hypertension
  Peripheral vascular disease

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:
Vitals: BP 148/92, HR 112, Temp 102.6°F (38.9°C), RR 18, O2 Sat 97%

Right Knee:
  Inspection: Marked effusion, overlying erythema, significant swelling
  Temperature: Markedly warm compared to left knee
  ROM: Severely limited by pain — patient refuses to move knee
  Palpation: Diffuse tenderness, no distinct joint line localization
  Weight-bearing: Refuses — cannot bear weight

LABORATORY:
  WBC: 18,400 (elevated, left shift)
  ESR: 88 mm/hr (elevated)
  CRP: 14.2 mg/L (markedly elevated)
  Uric acid: 9.8 mg/dL (elevated)
  Blood glucose: 318 mg/dL (poor control)
  Blood cultures: Pending x 2 sets

  Joint Aspiration — Right Knee (performed at bedside):
  Aspirate appearance: Turbid, yellow-green
  Volume: 35 mL aspirated
  WBC synovial: 68,400 (markedly elevated — highly suspicious for septic arthritis)
  % PMN: 94%
  Crystals: Rare monosodium urate crystals (gout cannot be excluded, but
  does NOT exclude concurrent bacterial infection)
  Gram stain: Pending
  Culture: Pending

IMAGING:
  X-ray Right Knee (01/31/2025):
  Significant soft tissue swelling and effusion. No fracture. No obvious
  gas in joint space. Pre-existing mild OA changes.

IMPRESSION:
  1. Suspected septic arthritis, right knee (ICD-10: M00.062) — URGENT
  2. Cannot exclude concurrent gout/pseudogout
  3. Poorly controlled diabetes — significant infection risk factor

RED FLAG EXCEPTION — MEDICAL NECESSITY:
This patient meets the RED FLAG EXCEPTION for immediate advanced imaging under
Utah Medicaid Imaging Policy. Conservative care requirement is waived.

  [X] Suspected joint infection — fever, elevated WBC/CRP/ESR,
      turbid aspirate with 68,400 WBC
  [X] Red flag symptoms present
  [X] Emergency presentation with inability to bear weight

MRI Right Knee with contrast (CPT: 73722) ordered to:
  1. Evaluate extent of infection — joint vs. periarticular soft tissue
  2. Rule out osteomyelitis
  3. Assess for abscess formation requiring surgical drainage
  4. Guide surgical vs. medical management decision (washout urgency)

PLAN:
  - IV antibiotics initiated (Vancomycin + Ceftriaxone) pending cultures
  - Orthopedic surgery emergently consulted for possible surgical washout
  - MRI with contrast ordered STAT
  - Admission to medicine service under infectious disease co-management
  - Endocrinology consulted for diabetes management during hospitalization
