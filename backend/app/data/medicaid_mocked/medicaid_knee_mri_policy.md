- New symptoms or complications including:
  - Suspected graft failure or rupture
  - Suspected hardware complication
  - Infection not confirmed by other imaging or aspiration
  - Unexplained persistent pain >3 months post-operation
  - Loss of range of motion >30° compared to immediate post-op baseline

#### 5. **Suspected Osteochondral Defect or Osteonecrosis**

**Required Documentation:**
- Plain films showing:
  - Subchondral lucency or sclerosis, OR
  - Joint space narrowing in patient <50 years old, OR
  - Unexplained bone abnormality
- Clinical symptoms for >6 weeks including:
  - Pain at rest or with minimal activity
  - Night pain
  - Inability to bear weight

#### 6. **Suspected Neoplasm or Infection**

  - Joint aspiration showing WBC >25,000 with >75% PMNs, OR
  - Clinical signs of septic arthritis (fever, warmth, inability to bear weight)

**Conservative Therapy Requirement:** NOT REQUIRED

#### 7. **Recurrent Hemarthrosis**

**Required Documentation:**
- At least 2 documented episodes of acute knee swelling with aspiration showing blood
- Bleeding disorder workup completed
