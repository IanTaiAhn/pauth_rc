PRIOR AUTHORIZATION REQUIRED: YES

All requests for CPT 73721 (MRI knee without contrast) require prior

If imaging is not completed within the authorization period, a new prior
authorization request must be submitted.

================================================================================
SECTION 2: COVERAGE CRITERIA

MRI of the knee without contrast (CPT 73721) is covered as a Medicaid benefit
when ALL of the following criteria are met:

2.1 ELIGIBLE DIAGNOSIS

Member must have a documented diagnosis from one of the following categories:

Category A — Suspected Structural Pathology:
  - Suspected meniscal tear (ICD-10: M23.20x, M23.21x, M23.22x, M23.30x)
  - Suspected ligamentous injury — partial or complete (ICD-10: S83.5xx, S83.6xx,
    S83.9xx, M23.60x, M23.61x, M23.62x)
  - Suspected osteochondral lesion or osteochondritis dissecans (ICD-10: M93.2xx)
  - Knee pain with mechanical symptoms — locking, catching, giving way (ICD-10: M25.561,
    M25.562, M25.569)

Category B — Osteoarthritis Requiring Surgical Planning:
  - Osteoarthritis of knee requiring pre-surgical evaluation (ICD-10: M17.0x,
    M17.1x, M17.2x, M17.3x) — must document surgical candidacy per Section 2.5

2.2 CLINICAL FINDINGS REQUIREMENT

At least ONE of the following clinical findings must be documented on physical
examination within 30 days prior to the PA request:

  (a) Positive McMurray's test or Thessaly test
  (b) Joint line tenderness with mechanical symptoms (locking, catching, or giving way)
  (c) Persistent joint effusion present for more than 4 weeks
  (d) Positive Lachman test or anterior/posterior drawer test
  (e) Instability on varus or valgus stress testing
  (f) Restricted range of motion with a documented mechanical block

2.3 PRIOR IMAGING REQUIREMENT

Weight-bearing radiographs (X-rays) of the affected knee must be completed
within 60 calendar days prior to the date of the MRI prior authorization request.

  Requirements:
  - Minimum two views required (AP and lateral); three views preferred
  - Weight-bearing AP view is required except when contraindicated
  - Radiograph report must be available in the medical record
  - If X-rays were performed at an outside facility, the report must be
    obtained and included in the prior authorization documentation

2.4 CONSERVATIVE TREATMENT REQUIREMENT

Member must have completed a minimum of SIX WEEKS (42 consecutive calendar days)
of conservative therapy. Documentation must reflect completion of at least
TWO of the following treatment modalities:

  (a) Physical therapy — minimum of 6 documented sessions with a licensed
      physical therapist; PT notes must include dates of service, treatment
      techniques, and functional status assessments
  (b) Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) or oral analgesics —
      documented trial of at least 4 weeks duration; medication name, dose,
      and frequency must be recorded
  (c) Activity modification and a documented home exercise program
  (d) Bracing, orthotics, or assistive devices (cane, crutches)
  (e) Intra-articular injection (corticosteroid or hyaluronic acid) —
      documentation must include date, medication, and response

  Note: Multiple modalities may be completed concurrently. Total duration of
  conservative care must be at least 6 weeks.

  Note: If NSAIDs are medically contraindicated (e.g., renal insufficiency,
  history of GI bleeding), documentation of contraindication and use of an
  alternative analgesic will satisfy the medication trial requirement.

2.5 SPECIAL POPULATION REQUIREMENTS

2.5(a) Members Under Age 18:
  - Pediatric orthopedic evaluation by a board-certified or board-eligible
    pediatric orthopedic surgeon must be documented prior to PA approval
  - Growth plate (physeal) assessment must be included in the evaluation

2.5(b) Members Age 65 and Older:
  - Documentation of functional impact on activities of daily living required
  - Assessment of surgical candidacy required — provider must document
    whether patient is a surgical candidate and the basis for this determination
  - If patient is not a surgical candidate, MRI is covered only if results
    will directly change non-surgical management

================================================================================
SECTION 3: EXCEPTIONS TO CONSERVATIVE TREATMENT REQUIREMENT
================================================================================

The 6-week conservative treatment requirement is WAIVED when ANY of the
following exception criteria are documented:

3.1 Acute Traumatic Injury Exceptions:
  (a) Acute traumatic injury with inability to bear weight at the time
      of evaluation
  (b) Suspected complete rupture of a major ligament (ACL, PCL, MCL, LCL)
      based on clinical examination
  (c) Clinical findings consistent with displaced meniscal tear (locked knee)
      — documented inability to achieve full extension

3.2 Post-Operative Exception:
  (d) Post-operative evaluation required within 6 months of knee surgery
      — must include the surgical date and operative report reference

3.3 Red Flag Exception:
  (e) Red flag symptoms present, including:
      - Suspected joint infection (septic arthritis) — fever, elevated
        inflammatory markers, turbid joint aspirate
      - Suspected primary or metastatic tumor of bone or soft tissue
      - Suspected occult fracture not visualized on X-ray

  When an exception applies, documentation must clearly state which exception
  criterion is met. Emergency authorizations may be requested by telephone
  (see Section 6).

================================================================================
SECTION 4: EXCLUSIONS — NOT COVERED
================================================================================

MRI knee without contrast (CPT 73721) is NOT covered under Utah Medicaid when:

      symptoms or instability
  (c) Mild osteoarthritis when no surgical planning is intended
  (d) Worker's compensation injury — must be billed to WC carrier; see
      Utah Labor Commission billing rules
  (e) Member declines surgical intervention regardless of MRI findings —
      unless MRI results will directly modify non-surgical management
      plan (must be documented)
  (f) Repeat MRI within 12 months without documented: (i) change in clinical

      (iii) pre-operative planning requirement
