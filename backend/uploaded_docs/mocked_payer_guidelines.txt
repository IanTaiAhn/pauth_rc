Knee MRI Clinical Decision Support
Document ID: RAD-KNEE-2024-SUPP
Version: 2.1

================================================================================
CLINICAL CONTEXT AND EVIDENCE BASIS
================================================================================

These supplementary guidelines provide additional context for knee MRI 
authorization decisions.

CONSERVATIVE THERAPY DEFINITIONS:

Physical Therapy:
- Minimum 6 sessions over 6-week period
- Must include documented treatment plan with objective measures
- Home exercise program compliance documented
- Acceptable if member unable to tolerate due to pain severity

NSAIDs/Analgesics:
- Minimum 4-week trial at therapeutic doses
- Document medication name, dose, frequency, duration
- May substitute with documented reason if contraindicated

Activity Modification:
- Documentation of specific modifications attempted
- Work restrictions if applicable
- Use of assistive devices

SPECIAL POPULATIONS:

Athletes (High School, College, Professional):
- Expedited review process available
- Conservative care may be shortened to 3-4 weeks if documented 
  competitive season timeline
- Must still meet diagnostic and clinical criteria

Elderly (>75 years):
- Surgical candidacy assessment required
- Document discussion of risks/benefits of surgical intervention
- Consider conservative management as definitive treatment

Obesity (BMI >35):
- Document weight optimization plan if surgical candidate
- May require bariatric or nutrition consultation documentation for 
  surgical planning cases

IMAGING INTERPRETATION CONSIDERATIONS:

X-ray findings that support MRI necessity:
- Joint space narrowing (any grade)
- Osteophyte formation
- Subchondral sclerosis
- Loose bodies
- Effusion on cross-table lateral view

X-ray findings that may argue against MRI:
- Severe tricompartmental arthritis (may proceed directly to arthroplasty)
- Acute fracture visible on X-ray (CT may be more appropriate)

TIMEFRAME CLARIFICATIONS:

"6 weeks of conservative therapy":
- Calculate from first documented treatment intervention
- Need not be continuous if compliant during treatment period
- Gaps in care acceptable if documented (holidays, illness, scheduling)

"Recent clinical notes":
- Preferably within 14 days
- Up to 30 days acceptable if clinical status stable
- Older notes acceptable if clearly documented "no interval change"

RED FLAGS requiring expedited review:
- Suspected septic arthritis (fever, severe pain, systemic symptoms)
- Suspected tumor or malignancy (night pain, unexplained weight loss)
- Neurovascular compromise
- Acute locked knee unable to extend

AUTHORIZATION OUTCOMES:

APPROVED: All criteria clearly met
PENDED: Missing documentation, request additional records within 5 business days
DENIED: Criteria not met, specific deficiencies listed in denial letter
PEER-TO-PEER: Complex case, offer physician reviewer discussion

FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS
================================================================================

Q: Can physical therapy and NSAIDs occur simultaneously?
A: Yes, simultaneous treatment counts as conservative care. Total duration 
   must be at least 6 weeks.

Q: What if patient cannot tolerate physical therapy due to pain?
A: Document attempt and reason for intolerance. If pain prevents PT, this 
   may support medical necessity. Ensure other conservative measures attempted.

Q: Does chiropractic care count as conservative treatment?
A: Yes, if documented and includes specific knee treatment. Must still meet 
   6-week minimum duration.

Q: Member had MRI 8 months ago at another facility. Do they need a new one?
A: Review indication. If new injury or significant clinical change, yes. 
   If same complaint without interval change, consider obtaining outside 
   imaging records first.

Q: What BMI threshold triggers need for weight optimization?
A: No absolute threshold. For BMI >40, document discussion of weight impact 
   on surgical outcomes if planning surgical intervention.
