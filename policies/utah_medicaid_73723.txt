AUTHORITY
This policy is issued pursuant to Utah Code Ann. § 26B-3-109 and the Utah
Medicaid State Plan. Coverage determinations made per 42 C.F.R. § 440.230
and 42 C.F.R. § 440.240.

================================================================================
SECTION 1: PRIOR AUTHORIZATION REQUIREMENT
================================================================================

PRIOR AUTHORIZATION REQUIRED: YES

CPT 73723 (MRI knee without and with contrast) requires prior authorization.
This code represents the most comprehensive knee MRI protocol and is reserved
for complex clinical presentations where both pre-contrast and post-contrast
sequences are required. Requests must document clinical necessity for both
the non-contrast and contrast components.

IMPORTANT NOTE ON CODE SELECTION:
  - If non-contrast imaging alone is sufficient: use CPT 73721
  - If contrast-only is clinically indicated: use CPT 73722
  - CPT 73723 is appropriate only when the COMBINATION of pre-contrast
    and post-contrast sequences is clinically required and provides
    diagnostic information not available from either alone

Authorizations are valid for 60 calendar days from the date of approval.

================================================================================
SECTION 2: COVERAGE CRITERIA
================================================================================

MRI of the knee without and with contrast (CPT 73723) is covered when ALL
of the following criteria are met:

2.1 STANDARD CRITERIA (All Must Be Met)

All criteria from Policy DMHF-IMG-MRI-001 (CPT 73721) must first be satisfied:
  - Eligible diagnosis
  - Clinical findings requirement
  - Prior imaging within 60 days
  - Conservative treatment completed OR applicable exception documented

AND all contrast safety documentation from Policy DMHF-IMG-MRI-002 (CPT 73722)
Section 2.3 must be satisfied (eGFR documentation, allergy screening).

2.2 CLINICAL INDICATIONS REQUIRING COMBINED WITHOUT/WITH CONTRAST PROTOCOL

At least ONE of the following must be documented as the reason the combined
protocol is required:

Category A — Tumor/Neoplasm Characterization (Most Common Indication):
  (a) Known or suspected primary bone tumor (e.g., osteosarcoma, chondrosarcoma,
      giant cell tumor) — pre-contrast sequences establish baseline signal
      characteristics; post-contrast shows enhancement patterns critical for
      grading, staging, and surgical planning
  (b) Known or suspected soft tissue sarcoma or benign soft tissue neoplasm
      (e.g., lipoma vs. liposarcoma differentiation requires pre- and
      post-contrast sequences)
  (c) Metastatic disease surveillance or treatment response assessment when
      protocol specifies combined sequences per oncology plan

Category B — Complex Infection with Abscess Assessment:
  (d) Suspected or confirmed septic arthritis with clinical concern for
      periarticular abscess or osteomyelitis — pre-contrast sequences
      identify fluid collections and edema patterns; post-contrast confirms
      rim-enhancing abscess vs. simple effusion and extent of synovial
      involvement
  (e) Suspected osteomyelitis of the distal femur or proximal tibia —
      combined protocol provides superior assessment of bone marrow
      involvement, cortical breach, and soft tissue extension

Category C — Post-Operative Complex Evaluation:
  (f) Evaluation of post-operative complications where distinguishing scar
      tissue (non-enhancing) from recurrent tumor, infection, or active
      synovitis (enhancing) is required
  (g) Assessment of graft integrity following ligament reconstruction (e.g.,
      ACL reconstruction) where vascular ingrowth and graft maturation
      assessment requires contrast enhancement patterns

Category D — Vascular/Avascular Necrosis:
  (h) Avascular necrosis with subchondral collapse or suspected viability
      assessment — pre-contrast identifies marrow edema; post-contrast
      differentiates viable from necrotic tissue for surgical planning
      (core decompression vs. arthroplasty decision)

Category E — Complex Synovial Disease:
  (i) PVNS (pigmented villonodular synovitis) or synovial chondromatosis
      when pre-contrast susceptibility sequences and post-contrast
      enhancement patterns are both required for diagnosis confirmation
      and surgical planning
  (j) Inflammatory arthritis with synovial pannus assessment — combined
      protocol required when pre- and post-contrast sequences are both
      specified in the rheumatology or orthopedic management protocol

2.3 RADIOLOGY PROTOCOL JUSTIFICATION

For CPT 73723, the ordering provider OR a consulting radiologist must document:

  (a) Clinical indication for combined protocol (not just contrast alone)
  (b) Why non-contrast sequences alone (73721) would be insufficient
  (c) Why the combination of pre- and post-contrast sequences is required
      for clinical decision-making

  Acceptable documentation: A written statement in the order or clinical
  notes; or a radiology protocol recommendation from a board-certified
  radiologist specifying 73723.

================================================================================
SECTION 3: EXCEPTIONS TO CONSERVATIVE TREATMENT REQUIREMENT
================================================================================

Same exception criteria as CPT 73721 Policy (Section 3). For tumor and
infection indications under Category A and Category B, the conservative
care requirement is automatically waived given the clinical urgency.

Emergency authorization: Call PA hotline 1-800-662-9651 for same-day review.

================================================================================
SECTION 4: EXCLUSIONS — NOT COVERED
================================================================================

CPT 73723 is NOT covered when:

  (a) The combined protocol is not clinically necessary — if 73721 or 73722
      alone would provide adequate diagnostic information, the lower-complexity
      code should be used
  (b) All exclusion criteria from CPT 73721 policy (Section 4) apply
  (c) eGFR < 30 without nephrologist consultation (same as 73722 policy)
  (d) Contrast is clinically contraindicated and alternative imaging
      approach has not been explored
  (e) Request is based solely on protocol preference without specific
      clinical indication for the combined sequence

================================================================================
SECTION 5: DOCUMENTATION REQUIREMENTS FOR PA SUBMISSION
================================================================================

REQUIRED:
  [ ] All documentation required for CPT 73721 (standard criteria)
  [ ] All contrast safety documentation required for CPT 73722
  [ ] Specific clinical indication from Section 2.2 documented
  [ ] Clinical justification for combined (without AND with) protocol — why
      non-contrast or contrast alone is insufficient
  [ ] For tumor indications:
        Oncology notes, biopsy results, prior imaging, surgical planning notes
  [ ] For infection with abscess concern:
        Complete labs (CBC with diff, ESR, CRP, blood cultures, synovial
        fluid results), infectious disease consult if available
  [ ] For post-operative complex evaluation:
        Operative report from index surgery, post-operative clinical course
  [ ] For AVN:
        Prior X-rays or bone scan if available, clinical symptoms and
        functional status, orthopedic surgical planning notes
  [ ] Renal function documentation (creatinine/eGFR) per Section 2.3
  [ ] Contrast allergy screening documentation

================================================================================
SECTION 7: BILLING AND CODING NOTES
================================================================================

  73723 includes both the non-contrast and contrast-enhanced sequences as a
  single procedure. Do NOT bill 73721 + 73722 together — use 73723 when
  both pre- and post-contrast sequences are performed in the same session.

  Modifier usage:
  - LT/RT modifiers required for laterality (left knee / right knee)
  - Bilateral knee MRI in same session: bill with modifier 50 (bilateral)
    — requires documentation of bilateral clinical indication and separate
    PA approval for bilateral imaging

================================================================================
SECTION 8: RELATED PROCEDURE CODES
================================================================================

  73721 — MRI knee, without contrast (policy DMHF-IMG-MRI-001)
