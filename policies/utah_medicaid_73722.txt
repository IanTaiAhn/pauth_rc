AUTHORITY
This policy is issued pursuant to Utah Code Ann. § 26B-3-109 and the Utah
Medicaid State Plan. Coverage determinations are made in accordance with
42 C.F.R. § 440.230 and 42 C.F.R. § 440.240.

================================================================================
SECTION 1: PRIOR AUTHORIZATION REQUIREMENT
================================================================================

PRIOR AUTHORIZATION REQUIRED: YES

CPT 73722 (MRI knee with contrast) requires prior authorization.
Contrast-enhanced MRI is an ADDITIONAL clinical threshold above standard
non-contrast MRI (CPT 73721). PA requests for 73722 must satisfy the criteria
in this policy. If non-contrast MRI would be clinically sufficient, 73721
should be requested instead.

Authorizations are valid for 60 calendar days from the date of approval.

================================================================================
SECTION 2: COVERAGE CRITERIA
================================================================================

MRI of the knee with intravenous contrast (CPT 73722) is covered when ALL of
the following criteria are met:

2.1 STANDARD CRITERIA (From CPT 73721 Policy — All Must Be Met)

All criteria from Policy DMHF-IMG-MRI-001 (CPT 73721) must first be satisfied:

  - Eligible diagnosis (see Section 2.1 of 73721 policy)
  - Clinical findings requirement (see Section 2.2 of 73721 policy)
  - Prior imaging within 60 days (see Section 2.3 of 73721 policy)
  - Conservative treatment completed (see Section 2.4 of 73721 policy),
    OR applicable exception documented (see Section 3 below)

2.2 ADDITIONAL CLINICAL INDICATIONS SPECIFIC TO CONTRAST-ENHANCED MRI

In addition to meeting standard criteria, at least ONE of the following
contrast-specific indications must be documented:

Category A — Infection / Inflammatory Conditions:
  (a) Suspected septic arthritis — fever, leukocytosis, synovial fluid
      analysis consistent with infection. Contrast is required to evaluate
      synovial enhancement, abscess formation, and periarticular involvement.
  (b) Suspected inflammatory arthropathy (e.g., rheumatoid arthritis,
      psoriatic arthritis, reactive arthritis) with active synovitis requiring
      characterization for treatment planning
  (c) Suspected pigmented villonodular synovitis (PVNS) or synovial
      chondromatosis (ICD-10: M12.2xx, D48.0)

Category B — Neoplastic Conditions:
  (d) Suspected primary bone tumor or soft tissue neoplasm of the knee or
      periarticular region — contrast is required for lesion characterization,
      vascularity assessment, and surgical planning
  (e) Suspected metastatic disease to the knee or distal femur/proximal tibia
  (f) Known malignancy — staging or treatment response evaluation

Category C — Vascular / Osteonecrosis:
  (g) Suspected avascular necrosis (osteonecrosis) of the femoral condyle
      or tibial plateau (ICD-10: M87.35x, M87.36x) — contrast enhances
      assessment of viable vs. necrotic bone
  (h) Suspected complex regional pain syndrome (CRPS) affecting the knee
      region requiring vascular characterization

Category D — Post-Operative Complications:
  (i) Evaluation of suspected post-operative complication where contrast
      is specifically required: wound infection with joint involvement,
      hardware infection, synovial fistula, or abscess
  (j) Assessment of post-operative healing and tissue viability when
      non-contrast MRI results are equivocal

2.3 CONTRAST SAFETY DOCUMENTATION

Prior to administration of gadolinium-based contrast agents (GBCAs), the
following must be documented:

  - Creatinine / eGFR within 6 months of imaging (required if member has
    known or suspected renal disease, diabetes, hypertension, or age ≥ 60)
  - eGFR ≥ 30 mL/min/1.73m² required for macrocyclic GBCA administration
  - For eGFR 30-44: use of macrocyclic GBCA required (not linear agents)
  - For eGFR < 30 or dialysis: contrast is generally contraindicated;
    document clinical necessity and nephrologist consultation

  Contraindications to contrast:
  - Known allergy to gadolinium-based contrast — requires allergy pre-medication
    protocol documentation
  - Prior severe allergic reaction to GBCA — attending physician review required
  - Pregnancy — contrast use in pregnancy requires documented risk/benefit
    discussion and consent

================================================================================
SECTION 3: EXCEPTIONS TO CONSERVATIVE TREATMENT REQUIREMENT
================================================================================

The same exception criteria as CPT 73721 Policy (Section 3) apply to 73722.
For contrast-specific indications in Category A (infection/inflammatory),
the conservative treatment requirement is automatically waived given the
acute or urgent nature of these presentations.

Emergency/urgent authorization process: same as 73721 policy (call PA hotline).

================================================================================
SECTION 4: EXCLUSIONS — NOT COVERED
================================================================================

CPT 73722 is NOT covered when:

  (a) Non-contrast MRI (CPT 73721) would be clinically sufficient for the
      documented indication — contrast must have a specific clinical rationale
  (b) All exclusion criteria from CPT 73721 policy (Section 4) apply
  (c) Contrast is requested solely for patient or provider preference without
      a clinical indication for contrast enhancement
  (d) eGFR < 30 without documented nephrologist consultation and risk/benefit
      assessment
  (e) Patient declines contrast administration — non-contrast MRI (73721)
      should be considered if clinically appropriate

================================================================================
SECTION 5: DOCUMENTATION REQUIREMENTS FOR PA SUBMISSION
================================================================================

REQUIRED (in addition to standard 73721 documentation):
  [ ] All documentation required for CPT 73721 (see Section 5, Policy 73721)
  [ ] Specific clinical indication for contrast enhancement (from Section 2.2)
  [ ] For infection/inflammatory: laboratory results (CBC, CRP, ESR, culture
      results, synovial fluid analysis if available)
  [ ] For neoplasia: biopsy results, prior imaging, oncology notes as available
  [ ] For post-operative: prior operative report, post-op clinical notes
  [ ] Renal function documentation (creatinine/eGFR) when indicated per
      Section 2.3 criteria
  [ ] Contrast allergy documentation and pre-medication protocol if applicable

SECTION 7: RELATED PROCEDURE CODES
================================================================================

  73721 — MRI knee, without contrast (policy DMHF-IMG-MRI-001)
  73722 — MRI knee, with contrast (THIS POLICY)
  73723 — MRI knee, without contrast followed by with contrast
           (see policy DMHF-IMG-MRI-003)

Note: CPT 73722 (with contrast only) is less commonly used than 73723
(without and with contrast). If both pre- and post-contrast sequences
are needed, request 73723 per its separate policy.
