"""
Tests for the two-step compilation pipeline.
"""

# TODO: Add tests once the pipeline is wired up and a real policy is compiled.
# Suggested test cases:
#   - compile() returns a dict with all required keys
#   - structurer.create_skeleton() returns valid section structure
#   - detailer.fill_details() preserves payer/lcd_code identity
