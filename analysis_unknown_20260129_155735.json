      "[unknown:general_0] Complex case, offer physician reviewer discussion ================================================================================ FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS ================================================================================ Q: Can physical therapy and NSAIDs occur simultaneously? A: Yes, simultaneous treatment counts as conservative care. Total duration must be at least 6 weeks. Q: What if patient cannot tolerate physical therapy due to pain? A: Document attempt and reason for intolerance. If pain prevents PT, this may support medical necessity. Ensure other conservative measures attempted. Q: Does chiropractic care count as conservative treatment? A: Yes, if documented and includes specific knee treatment. Must still meet 6-week minimum duration. Q: Member had MRI 8 months ago at another facility. Do they need a new one? A: Review indication. If new injury or significant clinical change, yes. If same complaint without interval change, consider obtaining outside imaging records first. Q: What BMI threshold triggers need for weight optimization? A: No absolute threshold. For BMI >40, document discussion of weight impact on surgical outcomes if planning surgical intervention....",
